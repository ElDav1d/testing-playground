# APPLYING UNIT TESTS TO A NEXT.JS PROJECT EXERCISE

My first experience with Jest and React Testing Library: from a pre-existing Next.js + Typescript project ([https://github.com/ElDav1d/worlds-rank]) to a (slightly) tested app.

Test coverage is mainly about DOM rendering, and tests cases have not so much sense but pattern learning purposes.

## Getting Started

Install:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
